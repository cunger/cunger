### Hi, I'm Christina.

I’m a software engineer in the middle of start-up roller coaster loopings at [Mercury.ai](https://mercury.ai). I have a background in research, and experience in application development, expert systems and formal methods. 

**(Not so) random facts about me:** 

🐞 I love bug hunting.

🌊 My favourite places are underwater and outer space.

☢️ When I'm not deep inside code, I study the fundamentals of nuclear engineering.
