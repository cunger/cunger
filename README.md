### Hi, I'm Christina.

I’m a software engineer in the middle of the start-up roller coaster at [Mercury.ai](https://mercury.ai). I have a background in research, and experience in application development, expert systems and formal methods. 

**Pseudo-random facts about me:** 

🐞 I really enjoy bug hunting.

☢️ In my spare time (and energy), I study the fundamentals of nuclear engineering.

🌊 My favourite places are underwater and outer space.
