🌍 🛰️ Software engineer at [OKAPI:Orbits](https://www.okapiorbits.space/).

☕ Coding in Java (and sometimes Python, TypeScript, or Fortran) for money, and in Ada for fun.

📚 I love to spend my early mornings learning stuff. Currently about profiling and performance optimization. If I have time also DSP, radar, and nuclear technology.

🛠️ I enjoy working with complex legacy code bases. (Yes, I really do!)

✨ Create and sell [stickers at Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sayitwithasticker).
