🌍 🛰️ I work as software engineer at [OKAPI:Orbits](https://www.okapiorbits.space/).

☕ 📚 I love to spend my early mornings learning stuff (Ada, DSP, profiling and performance optimization, etc) or digging through complex legacy code bases.

✏️ ✨ I create and sell [stickers at Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sayitwithasticker).
